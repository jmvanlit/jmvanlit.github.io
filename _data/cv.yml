  summary: I am a postdoctoral researcher and lecturer in comparative political science at Radboud University. 
  My research focuses on democratic erosion and democratic defence, examining how political elites, institutions, and citzens respond when democracy comes under pressure. 
  Using surveys, experiments, and in-depth interviews, my work connects comparative politics with real-world debates on democratic resilience in Europe and beyond.
