        summary: Together with a team at the University of Fribourg, under supervision of <a href= "https://www.unifr.ch/directory/en/people/366435/28485">Natasha Wunsch</a> we are building a novel measurement of citizens' commitment to liberal democracy. Within this project, I am investigating how liberal commitment impacts citizens' political behaviour and willingness to defend democracy.

      - name: Countering Autocratization
        summary: During my PhD project, I started working on several papers that investigate different <em>actors</em> and different <em>actions</em> of democratic defence. I seek to understand who is an effective defender of democracy, under what circumstances, and using what resistance strategies.
