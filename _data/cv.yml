        summary: During my PhD project, I started working on several papers that investigate different <em>actors</em> and different <em>actions</em> of democratic defence. I seek to understand who is an effective defender of democracy, under what circumstances, and using what resistance strategies.

        summary: Together with <a href = "https://mochtak.com/">Michal Mochtak<a/> I am developing a workflow to use deepfakes as research tools. An integral part of the project is to empirically investigate the ethical consequences and limits of this, as well as to develop effective deriefing procedures.
