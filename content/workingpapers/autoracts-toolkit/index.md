abstract: 'Since the 1990s, incumbent-led autocratization in democracies is increasingly common. However, there is surprisingly little systematic and comparative research into the actions would-be autocrats actually take when they undermine democracy. We combine the wealth of in-depth yet context-specific case studies with the case-selection strategies from the comparative literature to develop such an overview of autocratic actions inductively. This empirically-based autocrats toolkit encompasses about 400 unique autocratic actions which we classify into 7 overarching strategies: evasion, manipulation, infiltration, duplication, restriction, prohibition, and delegitimation. Would-be autocrats selectively use these different strategies in varying arenas of democracy to gradually erode democracy. The toolkit provides a starting-point to systematically study autocratization within and across different cases, enabling the identification of sequencing and diffusion patterns, and helping generate better understanding of when autocratization is successful.'
