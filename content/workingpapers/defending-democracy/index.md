abstract: 'When democracies are challenged by democratically elected incumbents, citizens are faced with two competing claims: incumbent justifications for the autocratic proposals versus democratic defenders' counter-claims that they harm democracy. While citizen involvement in the defense of democracy is paramount, up until now it is unclear under what circumstances citizens give more credence to which claim. We argue citizens judge the trade-off between incumbent and democratic defender based on the ambiguity surrounding the autocratic action and the defenders' credibility. A factorial survey experiment in the Netherlands, France, and Germany (n = 9.159) provides strong evidence for this argument. Citizen evaluations of autocratic actions depend more on the action's ambiguity and the credibility of democratic defenders than on the autocratic action itself. Our findings provide avenues for democratic defenders, but also warn of pitfalls and potential backlash against democratic defense.'
