summary: Report on Dutch democracy on behalf of the Dutch Ministry of the Interior
abstract: 'Worldwide, democratic erosion has become increasingly common in the last decade, scientific studies such as that of the V-Dem institute signal. Remarkably, democratic erosion is not limited to younger or electoral democracies. Signs of democratic erosion are also visible in older and liberal democracies. The fact that democratic erosion can also occur in established liberal democracies (think of the United States, Poland and Hungary, once the examples of successful democratisation in Europe), raises the question whether there are traces of democratic erosion in the Netherlands. And if so, what (re)actions and acts are likely to keep democracy sustainable and resilient? Led by researchers from Radboud University, a group of renowned Dutch scholars is mapping what signs of democratic erosion are, what contributes to the resilience of democracies against it and how to assess the Netherlands from that perspective. They examine constitutional and institutional frameworks, behaviour of actors in the political-administrative and social domain, the role of citizens, cross-border undermining of democracies and democratic norms and standards.'
