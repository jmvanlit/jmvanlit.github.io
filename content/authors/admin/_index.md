#    summary: |
#      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate #level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially #useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Hi! My name is Joep van Lit, and I am PhD candidate and lecturer in political science at Radboud University, Nijmegen. My dissertation focusses on the defense of democracy: who stands up, under what circumstances, and with what tools, to defend against attempts to autocratize by democratically elected leaders?
